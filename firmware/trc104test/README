trc104_test.c activates the TRC104 wireless transceiver and exercises the
serial control interface to verify that the TRC104 responds with an expected
default register value.

On success LED1 through LED8 indicate the bits of the tested register and LED11
flashes slowly.

You probably want to set:
	BOARD=BROCCOLI
and perhaps:
	LINKER_SCRIPT=LPC17xx_Linker_Script_without_bootloader.ld
